## Priority Updates

Add add and delete buttons for the Class Resources section

Add a drag and drop for the Attacks and Class Resources to allow them to be reordered

Refactor INFO and HELP section 

Fix Options button shading when it is open

Fix overlapping title/body bubbles overlapping on:
Backstory; Inventory; Spell Info; Spells

Bottom left button?

Calculate proficiency bonus & add level input
- Based on level and have it automatically update the sheet when level is changed (and lock it down so it can't be edited manually). Need to add in a level input for this. Maybe have a "Current Level" input at the top, and have another text box up there somwhere that the user can go into details about class/subclass/multiclassing/etc.

## "Must-Have" Updates

Change "Class Resources, Ammo, & Charges " to something more concise like "Class Resources & Item Charges"

Duplicate the attacks section with the sameish functionality, but for abilities that are not attacks, such as spellcasting or traits

Also try to make the tabs more intuitive - like maybe have a combat tab and a non-combat tab, or something like that



## "Stretch" Goals

Add in conditions that impact numbers, and have them automatically update the sheet when they are added or removed

Try to implement more automatic calculations and autofilling (as much as possible)
