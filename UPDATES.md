## Priority Updates
#### These are updates that I know how to implement and will add a lot of value to the sheet, so I want to prioritize these first

Add Attack button is fucked

Calculate proficiency bonus & add level input
- Based on level and have it automatically update the sheet when level is changed (and lock it down so it can't be edited manually). Need to add in a level input for this. Maybe have a "Current Level" input at the top, and have another text box up there somwhere that the user can go into details about class/subclass/multiclassing/etc.

## "Must-Have" Updates
#### But don't know how to implement yet

Duplicate the attacks section with the sameish functionality, but for abilities that are not attacks, such as spellcasting or traits

Also try to make the tabs more intuitive - like maybe have a combat tab and a non-combat tab, or something like that

Hit Dice section needs to be refactored to be better. Include stuff for multiclassing and make it more intuitive.



## "Stretch" Goals
#### Would be nice to have but might not be worth the time investment

Add in conditions that impact numbers, and have them automatically update the sheet when they are added or removed

Try to implement more automatic calculations and autofilling (as much as possible)
- Speed depending on race?


## Low Priority Updates
#### Things that kinda bug me but aren't super important to fix

Do we need to keep the bottom left button? It just scrolls to the top of the sheet but most screens have like half the screen full of information, so it doesn't seem super necessary. Maybe we can replace it with something else? Or just remove it entirely?

The Add A New Attack area is just kinda confusing
