# DnD Character Sheet TODO List

## Easy/High Priority

- [ ] Add in Drag and Drop for Attacks, spells, etc

- [ ] Make up and down arrow keys increase/decrease the number in textboxes where it will always be a number. This is only working in Item Charges

- [ ] more info per spell on the spell sheet (casting time, actions)

- [ ] Make a .ico

## Brainstorming/Low Priority

- [ ] Add Wiki Links to Everything
    - Maybe try to implement a way to have no input for the wiki link specifically, but based on the user's input for name try to create the wikidot link from that.
        - Like obviously we won't be able to make a wikidot link from "Longsword", but we could do it from like spell names and classes.
    - Have a small text input for a wiki link in the following sections:
        - Attacks
        - Actions
        - Resources/Charges
        - Spells
        - Class
        - Race
    - Come up with a middle ground for these. Some like Class and Species we can definitely generate (and even if it's not a real link they'll be using a), but for sure some will need a link input.

- [ ] Export to PDF functionality

- [ ] Custom page

- [ ] Import Spell Lists from Spellcasting Class
        - For example, Paladins, Clerics, etc have all spells known, but can only have a few prepared. Import all of them based on their Class (not all classes work obviously) and let the user just check them as prepared
