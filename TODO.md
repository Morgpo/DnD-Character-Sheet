# DnD Character Sheet TODO List

## Easy/High Priority

- [ ] make a character

--- 
---

## Brainstorming/Low Priority

- [ ] Standardize branding and reuse components where possible
        - some of the entire outline wodths don't match between pages

- [ ] Add Wiki Links to Everything
    - Maybe try to implement a way to have no input for the wiki link specifically, but based on the user's input for name try to create the wikidot link from that.
        - Like obviously we won't be able to make a wikidot link from "Longsword", but we could do it from like spell names and classes.
    - Have a small text input for a wiki link in the following sections:
        - Attacks
        - Actions
        - Resources/Charges
        - Spells
        - Class
        - Race
    - Come up with a middle ground for these. Some like Class and Species we can definitely generate (and even if it's not a real link they'll be using a), but for sure some will need a link input.
